Math 260 code examples. This repository will be updated along with the course with examples from lecture, homework and miscellaneous code.
If you find errors or files promised to be here are missing, please let me know.
Most of the example code here should run "out of the box", i.e. without further setup, except for code snippets with intentional gaps (notably, some HW template code).
